    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        My mother is from Chile and empanadas have been a staple in our household for years. I have searched and searched and never seem to find the right one, so here is our family-favorite recipe for Chilean empanadas. My mom likes to sprinkle sugar on hers, while I prefer to dip mine in a little mustard â€” we all have our own cravings! This recipe makes about a dozen large empanadas, depending on the size.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the filling: Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, oregano, cumin, salt, and pepper; cook and stir until onion is golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add pork and cook until completely browned and crumbly, 7 to 10 minutes more. Drain fat from the skillet. Stir in raisins, olives, and hard-cooked eggs.</li>
            <li>Whisk water and cornstarch together in a small bowl; pour into the skillet and stir until liquid thickens. Remove from the heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Make the dough: Whisk milk and melted shortening together in a bowl until evenly blended. Stir flour and salt together in a separate large bowl. Pour milk mixture into flour mixture; whisk until well combined and a dough forms. Let rest for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
